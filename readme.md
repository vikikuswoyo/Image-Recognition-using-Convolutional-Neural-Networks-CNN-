This is a project that uses deep learning techniques to classify images using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The model is built using the Keras framework in Python and trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the CNN model is the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

# Data Visualization

To better understand the performance of our models, we have created several visualizations of the results.

## Confusion Matrix

The confusion matrix is a useful tool for visualizing the performance of a classification model. It shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each class. We have created a confusion matrix for our image classification model using the Seaborn library. The resulting matrix is shown below:

As we can see from the matrix, our model performed well for most of the classes, with high accuracy rates for some classes such as **"ship"** and **"automobile"**. However, there are also some classes where the model performed poorly, such as **"cat"** and **"bird"**.

## Loss and Accuracy Curves

We have also plotted the loss and accuracy curves for our image classification model during training. These curves provide insight into how well the model is learning over time. The loss curve shows how the training loss decreases over time, while the accuracy curve shows how the training accuracy increases over time.

<img src="./docs/training_and_validation_loss.png" alt="Loss and Accuracy Curves">

As we can see from the curves, the model's training loss decreases steadily over time, indicating that it is learning to classify the images correctly. The training accuracy also increases over time, indicating that the model is becoming more accurate at classifying the images. However, we can see that the validation accuracy plateaus after a certain point, indicating that the model is overfitting to the training data. This is an area for future improvement.

# Limitations and Future Work

## Limitations

1. Limited Dataset: The **CIFAR-10** dataset used in this implementation consists of only _60,000_ images. A larger and more diverse dataset could lead to a better-performing model.

2. Computational Resources: Training a CNN model on a large dataset requires a significant amount of computational resources, which may not be available to everyone.

## Future Work

1. Transfer Learning: Transfer learning is a technique in which a pre-trained model is used as a starting point for a new model. This approach can be useful when training a CNN model on a limited dataset, as it can reduce the required training time and computational resources. Future work could involve exploring transfer learning techniques for image classification.

2. Multi-class Classification: The **CIFAR-10** dataset used in this implementation consists of 10 classes. Future work could involve extending the model to perform multi-class classification on a larger dataset.

3. Improving Model Performance: The performance of the CNN model could be improved by experimenting with different architectures, hyperparameters tuning, and regularization techniques.

# Conclusion

In this project, we have implemented image classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and evaluated the performance of the model on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We have achieved an accuracy of `83%` on the test set, which is a promising result.

We have also discussed the limitations of this implementation, such as the limited dataset, hyperparameters tuning, and computational resources required for training a CNN model on a large dataset. Additionally, we have suggested future work that can be done to improve the model's performance and explore new applications of CNNs, such as real-time object detection.

Overall, this implementation serves as a starting point for those interested in image classification using CNNs and provides a foundation for further research and experimentation in the field of computer vision.
